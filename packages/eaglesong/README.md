# Eaglesong

Eaglesong is a command line tool that makes Dota 2 custom game development:

- Easier: improved editor support helps to create addons without remembering Dota 2 API
- Faster: various code transformations reduce unnecessary boilerplate
- Safer: your scripts are validated against auto-generated API schemas
