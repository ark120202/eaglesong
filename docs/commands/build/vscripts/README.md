# VScripts

With this task you can write your custom game scripts in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It allows you to use more modern language, gives
better tooling and validates code, preventing most of errors as you type. This functionality is
powered by a [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/) project and auto-generated
[dota-lua-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dota-lua-types).
