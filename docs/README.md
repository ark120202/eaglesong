# Introduction

Eaglesong is a command line tool that makes Dota 2 custom game development:

🚀 Faster: various transformations reduce boilerplate and duplication in your code\
🛡️ Safer: your scripts are validated against auto-generated schemas\
🥚 Easier: improved editor support helps to create addons without remembering Dota 2 API

## Architecture

The main part is an [eaglesong](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eaglesong) package. It's a Node.js
command line application

All project code is centered in a single directory. That's the standard layout of a project created
with a @eaglesong/create-app
